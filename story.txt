Once upon a time there was a Bratwurst who lived in Berlin. 
His best friend was a hund named Doug. 
Doug was very fond of the Bratwurst for some reason, and followed him around in his Porsche.  
One day Doug brought the Bratwurst to the Flughafen so they could fly to Paris and eat Gebaeck.
They wouldn't let a Bratwurst and hund fly so instead they went to a Baeckerei to get apfelkuchen.
