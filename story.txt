Once upon a time there was a Bratwurst who lived in Berlin. 
His best friend was a hund named Doug. 
Doug was very fond of the Bratwurst for some reason, and followed him around in his Porsche.  
Bratwurst drove a BMW, they both sped around Berlin.
One day Doug brought the Bratwurst to the Flughafen so they could fly to Paris and eat Gebaeck.
They wouldn't let a Bratwurst and hund fly so instead they went to a Baeckerei to get apfelkuchen. 
After their apfelkuchen the two best friends went to Hauptstrasse where the little sausage was eaten by the hund. 
Despite his best efforts to fatten the Bratwurst up, the Hund remained hungry so he went back to Berlin and joined a Bratwurst Rammstein to make some new friends.  
When doug arrived at the Rammstein building he noticed another hund.
